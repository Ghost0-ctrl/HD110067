This repository docuements my journey into operating system development, starting from foundational concepts and progressing toward a custom kernel. The project is heavily inspired by tutorials, books, and open-source guides, but i am to reinforce my understanding by writing, testing, and modifying code on my own. Each step is documented to showcase what I've learned, highlight challenges, and explore new ideas along the way.

I will be implementing the bulk of my learning from the following resource, using it to serve as a guide moving forward in mastering OS internals and Kernel development.
