This repository documents my journey into operating system development, starting from foundational concepts and progressing toward a custom kernel. The project is heavily inspired by tutorials, books, and open-source guides, but I aim to reinforce my understanding by writing, testing, and modifying code on my own. Each step is documented to showcase what I’ve learned, highlight challenges, and explore new ideas along the way.

I will be implementing the bulk of my learning from the following resource, using it to serve as a guide moving forward in mastering OS internals and Kernel development.
