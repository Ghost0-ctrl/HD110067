This repository documents my journey into operating system development, starting from foundational concepts and progressing toward a custom kernel. The project is heavily inspired by tutorials, books, and open-source guides, but I aim to reinforce my understanding by writing, testing, and modifying code on my own. Each step is documented to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned, highlight challenges, and explore new ideas along the way.
